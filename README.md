# TURTLEBOT LOCALIZATION AND NAVIGATION USING ROS !

The repository contain the work done as part of the Robotics module For master in computer vision and robotics " VIBOT " , The Repository contain two diffrent methods for autonomous  robots Localization and Navigation , [behavior_based](https://github.com/ElJAZRY/ROS_PROJECT/tree/master/behavior_based "behavior_based") and [map_based](https://github.com/ElJAZRY/ROS_PROJECT/tree/master/map_based "map_based") , the two method represent diffrent approaches to the problem of autonomous robots Localization and Navigation , and compination of both to get the benefits of both methods

## SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|                |ASCII                          |HTML                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Single backticks|`'Isn't this fun?'`            |'Isn't this fun?'            |
|Quotes          |`"Isn't this fun?"`            |"Isn't this fun?"            |
|Dashes          |`-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash`|-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash|


```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

And this will produce a flow chart:

A --> C(Round Rect)
B --> D{Rhombus}
C --> D
```
