# TURTLEBOT LOCALIZATION AND NAVIGATION USING ROS !

The repository contain the work done as part of the Robotics module For master in computer vision and robotics " VIBOT " , The Repository contain two diffrent methods for autonomous  robots Localization and Navigation , [behavior_based](https://github.com/ElJAZRY/ROS_PROJECT/tree/master/behavior_based "behavior_based") and [map_based](https://github.com/ElJAZRY/ROS_PROJECT/tree/master/map_based "map_based") , the two method represent diffrent approaches to the problem of autonomous robots Localization and Navigation , and compination of both to get the benefits of both methods
